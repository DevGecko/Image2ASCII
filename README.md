## Upload and convert image to ASCII
With this online image converter you can upload your ipg, png, bmp and many other popular types of image.

After upload your photo will be converted into dense, consistent characters that form an overall picture.

## Tips
* To get the best quality, drag the Size bar up (this will take more processing time).
* Sharpness is used to shade text, which creates depth in the image.
* Blur to create a 5px blur.
* Download button to redraw ASCII into an image (it will take a lot of time if the size is large).
